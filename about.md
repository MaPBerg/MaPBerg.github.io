### The Basics
Professionally I am a project manager at WellMatch/iTriage.  We build tools that enable mastery over health for the individual.  I enjoy my job and the people I work with.  This website is the outcome of a fun sharing session one of our engineers did about Github and creating a website, so here I am.  I've dabbled in past lives as a high school English teacher (2 years) and a systems analyst (5 years) and I enjoyed my time in those roles.  

Personally I am a bit of a dilettante.  I have a wide variety of interests, much of which involves consuming cultural ephemera.  I love to read, especially scifi and fantasy, but I’ve also taken on the some of the classics (I was an English major after all).  I love play board games and tabletop games, yard games,any games really, which may say something about my love for rules and boundaries.  I can never spend enough time with my kids.  They have become my raison d’etre, and I don’t know where I would be without them.  I listen to a lot of podcasts while I’m out and about, doing chores, or whatever, and I generally keep my body moving as much as possible.

### The Project
Part of the project of this website for me is to shift away from being a consumer of media, art, stories, whatever, into being a creator.  There is something incredibly brave to me about people who create either for a living or just because they need to.  Over the past several years I feel I have not really created anything, aside from my children.  So it is time for me to take the leap into producing and creating, even if no one else ever sees, hears, reads, or uses anything I make.  I believe it will do my soul good.  

So without further ado, here is the BIG LIST.  It is full of things I want to accomplish or create.  Some of the things on the list are more flushed out than others, but it will be my reference point for all the blogs I write about my transition from consumer to creator.
