title: Helloooooooo out there
---

There is no sound in space, as there is nothing for sound waves to interact with.  Similarly, the internet can be a vacuum if there is no one interacting with what you put out there.  This is the beginning of my personal journey of self improvement and learning.  I plan to use this website to officially put out there the things I want to learn about, skills I want to obtain, and experiences I want to have.  Hopefully the accountability of the interwebs will give me the motivation to pursue those projects that I find interesting, and I'll report on my progress here.

Now to make a table with all the things I want to do (I do love my tables)
